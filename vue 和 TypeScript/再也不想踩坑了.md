### TypeScript 踩坑

### [(TypeScript) Property 'msg' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/834#issuecomment-366534774)
If you're using TS 2.7, try to turn it off by adding a "strictPropertyInitialization": false setting to the compilerOptions object within the tsconfig.json root file.  
if that doesn't fix it, try to temporarily downgrade to TS 2.6 and see if the error persists.
